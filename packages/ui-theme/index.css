/*
  UI Theme Package - Base Only

  This is the base theme with no brand-specific assumptions.
  Apps should explicitly import the theme they want to use.

  Usage in apps:

  Option 1: Base theme only (no shadcn)
    @import "@tfs-ucmp/ui-theme";

  Option 2: Base + Arrow theme (with shadcn)
    @import "@tfs-ucmp/ui-theme";
    @import "@tfs-ucmp/ui-theme/themes/arrow";

  Option 3: Base + Acme theme
    @import "@tfs-ucmp/ui-theme";
    @import "@tfs-ucmp/ui-theme/themes/acme";
*/
@import "./base/index.css";
